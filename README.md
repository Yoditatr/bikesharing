# _Overview of the analysis_

#### The Purpose of this analysis is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis. Hence, using August 2019 data from New York City's Citi Bike-Sharing Program as my case study I have made a tableau worksheet analysis and storyboard to convice that the idea of bikesharing is a profitable business in the city. 

# _Results_

#### Before I begin the analysis I will convert the datatype of the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype to get the time in hours and minutes by using Pandas in jupyter notebook. Becuase using Tableau instead of Pandas to change the datatype of the "tripduration" column to a "Date and Time" may take more time and might be less effective.
